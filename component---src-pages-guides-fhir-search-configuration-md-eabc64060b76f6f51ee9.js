If any filtering is configured in ",Object(i.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"fhir-server-config.json")," for resources that may be members of a compartment, their inclusion criteria search parameters should be included in the list of allowed search parameters. Again using the example above, if search parameter filtering is specified for the ",Object(i.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"Observation")," resource type, the ",Object(i.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"subject")," and ",Object(i.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"performer")," search parameters must be specified in the ",Object(i.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"searchParameters")," list (assuming an entry of ",Object(i.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},'"*": "*"')," is not specified) in order for ",Object(i.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"Observation")," resources to be returned in ",Object(i.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"Patient")," compartment searches. The following snippet illustrates a search parameter configuration in which the ",Object(i.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"subject")," and ",Object(i.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"performer")," search parameters have been included in the list of allowed search parameters:"),Object(i.b)("pre",null,Object(i.b)("code",{parentName:"pre"},'"resources": {\n    "open": true,\n    "Observation": {\n        "searchParameters": {\n            "_id": "http://hl7.org/fhir/SearchParameter/Resource-id",\n            "_lastUpdated": "http://hl7.org/fhir/SearchParameter/Resource-lastUpdated",\n            "patient": "http://hl7.org/fhir/SearchParameter/clinical-patient",\n            "category": "http://hl7.org/fhir/SearchParameter/Observation-category",\n            "code": "http://hl7.org/fhir/SearchParameter/clinical-code",\n            "status": "http://hl7.org/fhir/SearchParameter/Observation-status",\n            "date": "http://hl7.org/fhir/SearchParameter/clinical-date",\n            "subject": "http://hl7.org/fhir/SearchParameter/Observation-subject",\n            "performer": "http://hl7.org/fhir/SearchParameter/Observation-performer"\n        }\n    }\n}\n')),Object(i.b)("h2",null,"2 Re-index"),Object(i.b)("p",null,"Reindexing is implemented as a custom operation that tells the IBM FHIR Server to read a set of resources and replace the existing search parameters with those newly extracted from the resource body."),Object(i.b)("p",null,"The ",Object(i.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"$reindex")," operation can be invoked via an HTTP(s) POST to ",Object(i.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"[base]/$reindex"),".
