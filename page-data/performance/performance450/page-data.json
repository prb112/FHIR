Ingestion\n2. Client Access\n\n### Ingestion Workload\n\nThe *fhir-bucket* utility scans an IBM Cloud Object Store (COS) bucket for matching **json** or **ndjson** files. Matching files are recorded in the fhirbucket database and this information is subsequently used to drive the loading of those files into the IBM FHIR Server.\n\nThe test described here uses bundles based on Synthea - Synthetic Mass data. The original bundles have been preprocessed and broken into smaller bundles of no more than 100 resources. Resources within original bundles contain references to other resources within the same bundle. Traditionally, these references would be resolved by the IBM FHIR Server on ingestion. However, because the bundles are being broken into smaller units of work, the references must be resolved in advance. This requires that any create requests using server-asserted ids must be rewritten as client asserted id requests, using PUT.\n\nThe *fhir-bucket* uses a large thread-pool to fetch the bundles from COS and POST each to the IBM FHIR server. The result bundle is parsed and each of the returned logical resource ids are stored in the fhirbucket database, along with some timing metrics.\n\n### Client Access\n\nThe client access workload is generated using fhir-bucket running within the same K8s cluster. Random patients are selected from the `fhirbucket.logical_resources` table which is populated by first running the fhir-bucket ingestion mode. The client workload is comprised of the following steps:\n\n1. Select a random patient id and submit to the thread-pool;\n2. Create a Bundle resource containing a read for the patient resource and a search for ExplanationOfBenefit resources which refer to that patient **limit 20**;\n3. POST the bundle request;\n4. Process the response, constructing a new Bundle resource containing GET requests for each Claim and Provider referenced by the ExplanationOfBenefit resources contained in the first response.\n5. Collect statistics on the number of calls, number of resources returned and the time taken for each request.\n\nThe request bundles are configured to use a type of TRANSACTION. This provides the best performance as the IBM FHIR Server processes each request within the bundle using a single transaction, reducing the commit load on the database.\n\n\n## System Configuration\n\n|Configuration Item | Value|\n|------------------ | -----|\n|IBM FHIR Server | Release 4.5.0|\n|Client thread-pool size | 300|\n|FHIR Server Deployment Size | 6 PODS|\n|PostgreSQL Service | IBM Cloud Database|\n|PostgreSQL Version | 12.4|\n|PostgreSQL CPU | 9 cores **dedicated**|\n|PostgreSQL RAM | 24GB|\n|PostgreSQL Storage | 1TB **up to 10K IOPS**|\n\n\n## Top Resource Counts\n\nTop resource counts in the database using the query: \n```\n  SELECT rt.resource_type, count(*)\n    FROM fhirdata.logical_resources lr,\n         fhirdata.resource_types rt\n   WHERE rt.resource_type_id = lr.resource_type_id\nGROUP BY rt.resource_type\nORDER BY 2 DESC;\n```\n\n| resource_type                  |  count    |\n| ------------------ | --------------------- |\n|Observation                       | 28643640|\n|Claim                             |  9809811|\n|Procedure                         |  9533768|\n|Encounter                         |  8788209|\n|ExplanationOfBenefit              |  7795369|\n|DiagnosticReport                  |  2942204|\n|MedicationRequest                 |  2761835|\n|Condition                         |  1755335|\n|Immunization                      |  1656535|\n|CarePlan                          |  1320978|\n|Goal                              |   347835|\n|CareTeam                          |   341226|\n|Practitioner                      |   319783|\n|Organization                      |   319729|\n|AllergyIntolerance                |   216350|\n|Patient                           |   174388|\n\nThe full list is included at the end of this report.\n\n## Ingestion Performance\n\nTo compute the ingestion rate we can query the `fhirbucket.logical_resources` table, looking for the first and last creation times for the latest run of the loader, `loader_instance_id = 212` in the example below:\n\n```\nselect count(*), max(created_tstamp) - min(created_tstamp) as elapsed \n  from fhirbucket.logical_resources lr, fhirbucket.resource_bundle_loads bl \n where bl.resource_bundle_load_id = lr.resource_bundle_load_id\n   and bl.loader_instance_id = 212;\n```\n\n| count  |     elapsed      |\n|------- | -----------------|\n| 525525 | 00:09:19.253087  |\n\n\nIngestion rate: \n\n```\n525525 resources \n---------------- = 940 resources/second\n   559 seconds\n```\n\nThe inserts into the Observation parameter tables for token_values and quantity_values come from composite values, and there is room for improvement for how these inserts are handled:\n\n![Application Breakdown](https://ibm.github.io/FHIR/images/performance-450/Ingest_Application_Breakdown.png)\n\nThe GC activity is very reasonable given the complexity of FHIR resource parsing and validation:\n\n![GC CPU Time](https://ibm.github.io/FHIR/images/performance-450/Ingest_GC_CPU_Time.png)\n\nThe throughput is stable throughout the loading period:\n\n![Throughput](https://ibm.github.io/FHIR/images/performance-450/Ingest_Throughput.png)\n\nThe top database operations reflect what is seen in the application breakdown, with observation_token_values and observation_quantity_values being a good target for future improvement:\n\n![Top DB Operations](https://ibm.github.io/FHIR/images/performance-450/Ingest_Top_DB_Operations.png)\n\nTime series view of the same data:\n\n![TOP DB Operations Timeseries](https://ibm.github.io/FHIR/images/performance-450/Ingest_Top_DB_Ops_Timeseries.png)\n\n## Client Read Performance\n\nThe average server response time reported by the client is consistently under 180ms as shown below (statistics are sampled and printed by *fhir-bucket* every 10 seconds:\n\n```\nSTATS: FHIR= 1643.8 calls/s, rate=16825.1 resources/s, response time=0.179 s\nSTATS: FHIR= 1655.6 calls/s, rate=16860.8 resources/s, response time=0.178 s\nSTATS: FHIR= 1693.2 calls/s, rate=17323.5 resources/s, response time=0.176 s\nSTATS: FHIR= 1699.1 calls/s, rate=17431.5 resources/s, response time=0.174 s\nSTATS: FHIR= 1647.1 calls/s, rate=16849.2 resources/s, response time=0.179 s\nSTATS: FHIR= 1676.6 calls/s, rate=17180.6 resources/s, response time=0.176 s\nSTATS: FHIR= 1691.3 calls/s, rate=17242.2 resources/s, response time=0.175 s\nSTATS: FHIR= 1663.7 calls/s, rate=17043.8 resources/s, response time=0.178 s\nSTATS: FHIR= 1639.9 calls/s, rate=16723.9 resources/s, response time=0.175 s\nSTATS: FHIR= 1688.2 calls/s, rate=17329.2 resources/s, response time=0.175 s\nSTATS: FHIR= 1686.3 calls/s, rate=17232.8 resources/s, response time=0.174 s\nSTATS: FHIR= 1709.0 calls/s, rate=17542.6 resources/s, response time=0.173 s\nSTATS: FHIR= 1710.6 calls/s, rate=17441.1 resources/s, response time=0.173 s\nSTATS: FHIR= 1696.9 calls/s, rate=17409.0 resources/s, response time=0.174 s\nSTATS: FHIR= 1694.8 calls/s, rate=17330.2 resources/s, response time=0.173 s\nSTATS: FHIR= 1706.7 calls/s, rate=17415.4 resources/s, response time=0.173 s\nSTATS: FHIR= 1674.9 calls/s, rate=17205.6 resources/s, response time=0.177 s\n```\n\nThroughput is constrained by exhaustion of PostgreSQL CPU.\n\n## Client Workload Performance Metrics\n\nDatabase processing rate is slightly more than 3000 transactions per second. This reached 15K transactions/second when using BATCH as the bundle type instead of TRANSACTION. In that case, although the TPS is higher, the overall throughput is lower because each request required multiple transactions.\n\n![DB Transactions Per Second](https://ibm.github.io/FHIR/images/performance-450/Client_DB_Transactions_Per_Second.png)\n\n![Web Transaction Time](https://ibm.github.io/FHIR/images/performance-450/Client_Web_Transaction_Time.png)\n\nThe peak aggregate CPU usage for the POD (including the fhirbucket instance driving the test workload) is around 36 cores.\n\n![FHIR POD CPU Usage](https://ibm.github.io/FHIR/images/performance-450/Client_FHIR_CPU_Usage.png)\n\nNo significant hotspots in the application breakdown:\n\n![Application Breakdown](https://ibm.github.io/FHIR/images/performance-450/Client_Application_Breakdown.png)\n\nGC times are remarkably good, especially given the complexity of processing FHIR resources.\n\n![GC CPU Time](https://ibm.github.io/FHIR/images/performance-450/Client_GC_CPU_Time.png)\n\nThe top DB operations align with the above Application Breakdown.\n\n![Top DB Operations](https://ibm.github.io/FHIR/images/performance-450/Client_Top_DB_Operations.png)\n\n![Top DB Ops Timeseries](https://ibm.github.io/FHIR/images/performance-450/Client_Top_DB_Ops_Timeseries.png)\n\nThe database CPU is hitting its limit, suggesting that scaling up to more cores would increase throughput.\n\n![DB CPU Usage](https://ibm.github.io/FHIR/images/performance-450/Client_DB_CPU_Usage.png)\n\n##  Postgres Database Configuration\n\nName | Category | Setting | Unit | Description\n----

FHIR Server 4.5.0 - Performance \ndescription: Performance\ndate:   2020-10-29 01:00:00 -0400\npermalink: /performance/performance450/\n---\n\n# IBM FHIR Server 4.5.0 - Performance\n\n## Workloads\n\n1. Ingestion\n2. Client Access\n\n### Ingestion Workload\n\nThe *fhir-bucket* utility scans an IBM Cloud Object Store (COS) bucket for matching **json** or **ndjson** files. Matching files are recorded in the fhirbucket database and this information is subsequently used to drive the loading of those files into the IBM FHIR Server.\n\nThe test described here uses bundles based on Synthea - Synthetic Mass data. The original bundles have been preprocessed and broken into smaller bundles of no more than 100 resources. Resources within original bundles contain references to other resources within the same bundle. Traditionally, these references would be resolved by the IBM FHIR Server on ingestion. However, because the bundles are being broken into smaller units of work, the references must be resolved in advance. This requires that any create requests using server-asserted ids must be rewritten as client asserted id requests, using PUT.\n\nThe *fhir-bucket* uses a large thread-pool to fetch the bundles from COS and POST each to the IBM FHIR server. The result bundle is parsed and each of the returned logical resource ids are stored in the fhirbucket database, along with some timing metrics.\n\n### Client Access\n\nThe client access workload is generated using fhir-bucket running within the same K8s cluster. Random patients are selected from the `fhirbucket.logical_resources` table which is populated by first running the fhir-bucket ingestion mode. The client workload is comprised of the following steps:\n\n1. Select a random patient id and submit to the thread-pool;\n2. Create a Bundle resource containing a read for the patient resource and a search for ExplanationOfBenefit resources which refer to that patient **limit 20**;\n3. POST the bundle request;\n4. Process the response, constructing a new Bundle resource containing GET requests for each Claim and Provider referenced by the ExplanationOfBenefit resources contained in the first response.\n5. Collect statistics on the number of calls, number of resources returned and the time taken for each request.\n\nThe request bundles are configured to use a type of TRANSACTION. This provides the best performance as the IBM FHIR Server processes each request within the bundle using a single transaction, reducing the commit load on the database.\n\n\n## System Configuration\n\n|Configuration Item | Value|\n|------------------ | -----|\n|IBM FHIR Server | Release 4.5.0|\n|Client thread-pool size | 300|\n|FHIR Server Deployment Size | 6 PODS|\n|PostgreSQL Service | IBM Cloud Database|\n|PostgreSQL Version | 12.4|\n|PostgreSQL CPU | 9 cores **dedicated**|\n|PostgreSQL RAM | 24GB|\n|PostgreSQL Storage | 1TB **up to 10K IOPS**|\n\n\n## Top Resource Counts\n\nTop resource counts in the database using the query: \n```\n  SELECT rt.resource_type, count(*)\n    FROM fhirdata.logical_resources lr,\n         fhirdata.resource_types rt\n   WHERE rt.resource_type_id = lr.resource_type_id\nGROUP BY rt.resource_type\nORDER BY 2 DESC;\n```\n\n| resource_type                  |  count    |\n| ------------------ | --------------------- |\n|Observation                       | 28643640|\n|Claim                             |  9809811|\n|Procedure                         |  9533768|\n|Encounter                         |  8788209|\n|ExplanationOfBenefit              |  7795369|\n|DiagnosticReport                  |  2942204|\n|MedicationRequest                 |  2761835|\n|Condition                         |  1755335|\n|Immunization                      |  1656535|\n|CarePlan                          |  1320978|\n|Goal                              |   347835|\n|CareTeam                          |   341226|\n|Practitioner                      |   319783|\n|Organization                      |   319729|\n|AllergyIntolerance                |   216350|\n|Patient                           |   174388|\n\nThe full list is included at the end of this report.\n\n## Ingestion Performance\n\nTo compute the ingestion rate we can query the `fhirbucket.logical_resources` table, looking for the first and last creation times for the latest run of the loader, `loader_instance_id = 212` in the example below:\n\n```\nselect count(*), max(created_tstamp) - min(created_tstamp) as elapsed \n  from fhirbucket.logical_resources lr, fhirbucket.resource_bundle_loads bl \n where bl.resource_bundle_load_id = lr.resource_bundle_load_id\n   and bl.loader_instance_id = 212;\n```\n\n| count  |     elapsed      |\n|------- | -----------------|\n| 525525 | 00:09:19.253087  |\n\n\nIngestion rate: \n\n```\n525525 resources \n---------------- = 940 resources/second\n   559 seconds\n```\n\nThe inserts into the Observation parameter tables for token_values and quantity_values come from composite values, and there is room for improvement for how these inserts are handled:\n\n![Application Breakdown](https://ibm.github.io/FHIR/images/performance-450/Ingest_Application_Breakdown.png)\n\nThe GC activity is very reasonable given the complexity of FHIR resource parsing and validation:\n\n![GC CPU Time](https://ibm.github.io/FHIR/images/performance-450/Ingest_GC_CPU_Time.png)\n\nThe throughput is stable throughout the loading period:\n\n![Throughput](https://ibm.github.io/FHIR/images/performance-450/Ingest_Throughput.png)\n\nThe top database operations reflect what is seen in the application breakdown, with observation_token_values and observation_quantity_values being a good target for future improvement:\n\n![Top DB Operations](https://ibm.github.io/FHIR/images/performance-450/Ingest_Top_DB_Operations.png)\n\nTime series view of the same data:\n\n![TOP DB Operations Timeseries](https://ibm.github.io/FHIR/images/performance-450/Ingest_Top_DB_Ops_Timeseries.png)\n\n## Client Read Performance\n\nThe average server response time reported by the client is consistently under 180ms as shown below (statistics are sampled and printed by *fhir-bucket* every 10 seconds:\n\n```\nSTATS: FHIR= 1643.8 calls/s, rate=16825.1 resources/s, response time=0.179 s\nSTATS: FHIR= 1655.6 calls/s, rate=16860.8 resources/s, response time=0.178 s\nSTATS: FHIR= 1693.2 calls/s, rate=17323.5 resources/s, response time=0.176 s\nSTATS: FHIR= 1699.1 calls/s, rate=17431.5 resources/s, response time=0.174 s\nSTATS: FHIR= 1647.1 calls/s, rate=16849.2 resources/s, response time=0.179 s\nSTATS: FHIR= 1676.6 calls/s, rate=17180.6 resources/s, response time=0.176 s\nSTATS: FHIR= 1691.3 calls/s, rate=17242.2 resources/s, response time=0.175 s\nSTATS: FHIR= 1663.7 calls/s, rate=17043.8 resources/s, response time=0.178 s\nSTATS: FHIR= 1639.9 calls/s, rate=16723.9 resources/s, response time=0.175 s\nSTATS: FHIR= 1688.2 calls/s, rate=17329.2 resources/s, response time=0.175 s\nSTATS: FHIR= 1686.3 calls/s, rate=17232.8 resources/s, response time=0.174 s\nSTATS: FHIR= 1709.0 calls/s, rate=17542.6 resources/s, response time=0.173 s\nSTATS: FHIR= 1710.6 calls/s, rate=17441.1 resources/s, response time=0.173 s\nSTATS: FHIR= 1696.9 calls/s, rate=17409.0 resources/s, response time=0.174 s\nSTATS: FHIR= 1694.8 calls/s, rate=17330.2 resources/s, response time=0.173 s\nSTATS: FHIR= 1706.7 calls/s, rate=17415.4 resources/s, response time=0.173 s\nSTATS: FHIR= 1674.9 calls/s, rate=17205.6 resources/s, response time=0.177 s\n```\n\nThroughput is constrained by exhaustion of PostgreSQL CPU.\n\n## Client Workload Performance Metrics\n\nDatabase processing rate is slightly more than 3000 transactions per second. This reached 15K transactions/second when using BATCH as the bundle type instead of TRANSACTION. In that case, although the TPS is higher, the overall throughput is lower because each request required multiple transactions.\n\n![DB Transactions Per Second](https://ibm.github.io/FHIR/images/performance-450/Client_DB_Transactions_Per_Second.png)\n\n![Web Transaction Time](https://ibm.github.io/FHIR/images/performance-450/Client_Web_Transaction_Time.png)\n\nThe peak aggregate CPU usage for the POD (including the fhirbucket instance driving the test workload) is around 36 cores.\n\n![FHIR POD CPU Usage](https://ibm.github.io/FHIR/images/performance-450/Client_FHIR_CPU_Usage.png)\n\nNo significant hotspots in the application breakdown:\n\n![Application Breakdown](https://ibm.github.io/FHIR/images/performance-450/Client_Application_Breakdown.png)\n\nGC times are remarkably good, especially given the complexity of processing FHIR resources.\n\n![GC CPU Time](https://ibm.github.io/FHIR/images/performance-450/Client_GC_CPU_Time.png)\n\nThe top DB operations align with the above Application Breakdown.\n\n![Top DB Operations](https://ibm.github.io/FHIR/images/performance-450/Client_Top_DB_Operations.png)\n\n![Top DB Ops Timeseries](https://ibm.github.io/FHIR/images/performance-450/Client_Top_DB_Ops_Timeseries.png)\n\nThe database CPU is hitting its limit, suggesting that scaling up to more cores would increase throughput.\n\n![DB CPU Usage](https://ibm.github.io/FHIR/images/performance-450/Client_DB_CPU_Usage.png)\n\n##  Postgres Database Configuration\n\nName | Category | Setting | Unit | Description\n----
